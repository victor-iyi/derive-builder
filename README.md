# The Builder Design Pattern

This macro generates the boilerplate code involved in implementing the
[builder pattern] in Rust. Builders are a mechanism for instantiating structs,
especially structs with many fields, and especially if many of those fields are
optional or the set of fields may need to grow backward compatibly over time.

There are few different possibilities for espressing builders in Rust. To keep
things simple for this project, I used the example of the standard library's
[`std::process::Command`] builder in which the setter methods each receive and
return `&mut self` to allow chained method calls.

[`std::process::Command`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/process/struct.Command.html

## Usage

The caller will invoke the macro as follows:

```rust
use derive_builder::Builder;

#[derive(Builder)]
pub struct Command {
  executable: String,
  #[builder(each = "arg")]
  args: Vec<String>,
  #[builder(each = "env")]
  env: Vec<String>,
  current_dir: Option<String>,
}

fn main() {
  let command = Command::builder()
      .executable("cargo".to_owned())
      .arg("build".to_owned())
      .arg("--release".to_owned())
      .build()
      .unwrap();

  assert_eq!(command.executable, "cargo");
  assert_eq!(command.args, &["cargo", "--release"]);
  assert!(command.env.is_empty());
  assert!(command.current_dir.is_none());


  let command = Command::builder()
      .executable("cargo".to_owned())
      .arg("build".to_owned())
      .arg("--release".to_owned())
      .current_dir("..".to_owned())
      .build()
      .unwrap();

  assert_eq!(command.executable, "cargo");
  assert_eq!(command.args, &["cargo", "--release"]);
  assert!(command.env.is_empty());
  assert!(command.current_dir.is_some());
}
```
